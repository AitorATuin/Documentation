# GoboLinux Documentation

The GoboLinux documentation lives at https://github.com/gobolinux/Documentation/wiki

There's not much to see here in this repository. It exists to hold files linked in the wiki. Go there, read and contribute! :)

If you want to post images in the wiki such as screenshots, fork this repo, add the file to `images/` then send a pull request.
